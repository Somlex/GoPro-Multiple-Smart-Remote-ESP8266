# GoPro-Multiple-Smart-Remote-ESP8266
This code should show how to control several GoPros with a NodeMCU V1.0 (ESP-12E). It is designed for my purposes on four cameras.

A big thank you to theContentMint for the inspiration for UDP and the port being used.
Another thank you goes to KonradIT for inspiration ever to start with an ESP8266.
